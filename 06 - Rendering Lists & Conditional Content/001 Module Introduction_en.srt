00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,466
- [Instructor] By now we
know how to build components

2
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:08,132
and work with multiple components,

3
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,266
and we know how to work with state

4
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,266
and how to handle user events.

5
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:12,533
and how to handle user events.

6
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,400
In this course section,

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
we're now going to dive
into rendering lists

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,533
and rendering conditional content.

9
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:20,566
and rendering conditional content.

10
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:25,366
So we'll have a look at how
we can output arrays of data

11
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:28,900
on our page and how we
can show different content

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,866
based on different conditions,

13
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:31,200
based on different conditions,

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,633
and that's exactly what we're going

15
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,700
to dive into in this module.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,166
We're going to continue
working on the application

17
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,033
we already started over
the last course sections,

18
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:43,000
but in this module we're
now going to finish it

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,733
by adding these features.
