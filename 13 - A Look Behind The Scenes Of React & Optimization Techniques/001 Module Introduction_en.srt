00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:03,930
[Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller] At this point in the course

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,440
we are capable of building basic React apps.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,030
We learn a lot about some of the most important features

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,260
that are baked into React.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,720
But there's one thing that's really missing

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,430
or that we haven't had a close to look at until now.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,740
And that is how React actually works behind the scenes.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,440
Now, I know that to some students, this is not interesting.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,590
You might be one of them.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,510
And generally that's of course fine.

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,200
You are using a library like React

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,320
so that you don't have to do all the heavy lifting

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,153
on your own.

14
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:41,230
However, it really helps to understand

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,270
how something works that you're using

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,370
to ensure that you are using it correctly.

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,110
And whilst I, of course, do teach you common practices

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,650
and best practices throughout this course,

19
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,610
it nonetheless is important for you to know the tool

20
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,710
so that you are able to make the right decisions

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,090
in the apps you are going to build.

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,260
So even if that's not super interesting to you,

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,020
I would strongly recommend that you don't skip this module

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,630
and at least go through the videos at a higher speed

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,960
if you're really not interested.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,140
We'll also dive in some new features

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,080
which are related to the behind the scenes work.

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,610
So I would recommend that you at least watch

29
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,900
those lectures, though, they will, of course make more sense

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,240
if you watched the entire module.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,220
So what's in this module then?

32
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,070
We'll have a look at how React works behind the scenes.

33
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,120
That does not mean that we're going to dive

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,370
into the source code,

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,480
it means that I will show you how React works

36
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,540
with your components,

37
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,420
how it updates those components,

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,560
how State is related to all of that.

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,210
We'll understand that React uses

40
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,630
something which is called the Virtual DOM

41
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,980
and we'll understand how that works,

42
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,500
and how it affects updates made to the real Dom

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,230
which is in the end what drives your website in the browser.

44
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,240
And we'll take a closer look at state management,

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,120
how React does that.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,640
And how a State updates are managed by React.

47
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,220
A lot of important concepts.

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,643
So let's dive right in.
