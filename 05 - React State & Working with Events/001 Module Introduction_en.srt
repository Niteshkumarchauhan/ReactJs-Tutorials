1
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:03,200
Maximilian: Now, that we learned

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,000
about some important basics of React,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,533
most importantly, about components and props

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,366
It's time to take the next step.

5
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:11,500
It's time to take the next step.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,300
And in this course section, we're going to take

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,300
a closer look at user interaction and handling user events

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,333
like clicks or input into text fields and so on.

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:23,766
like clicks or input into text fields and so on.

10
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:27,066
And we're going to have a look at the very important concept

11
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:32,000
of state in React apps because, you might remember,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
that I mentioned earlier in the course

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,800
that with React we follow that declarative approach

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:38,933
that with React we follow that declarative approach

15
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:43,766
where we, in the end, define desired target states

16
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:48,266
and React then takes care about reaching that state.

17
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,766
Well, that is correct and that is already

18
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:53,366
something we're using but, at the moment,

19
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,833
in the application we built thus far

20
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,533
and with the knowledge we gained, up to this point,

21
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:58,866
and with the knowledge we gained, up to this point,

22
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:01,666
we can only build static applications

23
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:01,833
we can only build static applications

24
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,400
where the state never changes,

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,766
where we always output exactly the same.

26
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:07,966
where we always output exactly the same.

27
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,333
And that's typically not what you want.

28
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:14,200
You want to have applications which are interactive,

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,266
You want to have applications which are interactive,

30
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,733
so that you can React to clicks by the user

31
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:20,700
and to data being entered by the user

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,033
and to data being entered by the user

33
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:24,300
and which are reactive so that the application

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,100
also changes when certain things happen.

35
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,833
And, therefore, in this course module

36
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,766
we are going to take a look at handling events,

37
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:37,100
handling user events, like clicks and so on.

38
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,300
handling user events, like clicks and so on.

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,666
And we'll see how that works in React apps,

40
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,600
how we can add such event handlers and more.

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:42,933
how we can add such event handlers and more.

42
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:46,233
And then, we're going to take a look at how we can ensure

43
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:49,866
that what's visible on the screen changes,

44
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:50,066
that what's visible on the screen changes,

45
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,233
that we reach a different target state.

46
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,633
And for that, we're going to take a closer look

47
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:59,266
at this state concept in React

48
00:01:59,266 --> 00:01:59,333
at this state concept in React

49
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,533
and we'll learn how we can manipulate the state

50
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:08,066
and transition from state A to state B, if we want to.

51
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:10,666
And, in general, in this section

52
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,866
we're going to learn about a couple of key concepts.

53
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:13,900
we're going to learn about a couple of key concepts.

54
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,133
This is a section you absolutely should not skip.

55
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:19,400
And we're also going to take a closer look

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,833
at components and state again.

57
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:22,066
at components and state again.

58
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:25,566
So, this is another fundamental section covering

59
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,733
core features of React, so let's dive in.
