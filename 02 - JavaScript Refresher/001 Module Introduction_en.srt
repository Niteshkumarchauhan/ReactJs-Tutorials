1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,440
This course will teach you React

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,620
from the ground up and in great detail.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,960
But this course section here

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,900
will actually not be about React,

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,079
but instead about just JavaScript.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,950
It will allow you to refresh your JavaScript knowledge

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,420
and therefore, this course section here is optional.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,400
You can therefore skip it,

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,550
and you can of course also always come back to it

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,410
if later in the course

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,610
you see that you need some extra JavaScript help

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,890
because this course section here

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,060
is recommended if you haven't used JavaScript in a while

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,900
or if you don't have a lot of JavaScript experience.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,250
But I'll also say right away,

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,250
that this section does not replace a JavaScript course.

17
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,630
This section is not for you

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,590
if you have absolutely no JavaScript experience

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,090
because if that's the case,

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,800
you should definitely at least

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,900
explore some JavaScript basics

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,630
before continuing with this course.

23
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,100
But this section here,

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,430
will revisit crucial JavaScript concepts

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,010
and it will especially take a closer look at

26
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,260
the core JavaScript concepts you need

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,030
for building React apps,

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,940
so for writing React code, you could say

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,100
because in this section here

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,590
we will revisit the core JavaScript

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,230
syntax and rules you should follow

32
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,450
when writing JavaScript code.

33
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,750
We'll explore the essential modern JavaScript

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,510
features you should know in general,

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,050
and will, of course also, especially focus on the features

36
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,540
you need to write React code.

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,690
So the features you will use throughout this course,

38
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,883
that's what you'll get out of this section.
