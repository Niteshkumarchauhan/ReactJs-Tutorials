1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,540
So, let's dive right in.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,560
And for that, I prepared a CodeSandbox project,

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,600
a CodeSandbox environment,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,800
to which you, of course,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,380
find a link attached to this lecture,

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,620
which gives you a very basic web project

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,580
with an HTML file and some assets.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,220
No JavaScript code yet, though.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,820
And this is the project we'll use for playing around

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,780
with JavaScript and for exploring some basic features.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,460
I will also say, right away,

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,230
that we'll mostly write code

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,350
that will output content in the console,

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,900
which in CodeSandbox can be accessed

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,660
by clicking on "Console" here.

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,220
Because this section

17
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,280
is not about building some super fancy,

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,140
JavaScript-based project.

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,640
Instead, as mentioned,

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
it is about refreshing your JavaScript knowledge

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,910
and making sure that you have all the essentials you need

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,623
for building React apps.
