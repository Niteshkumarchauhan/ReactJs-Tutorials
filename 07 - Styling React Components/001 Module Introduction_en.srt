- [Maximilian] Building
web apps with React

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:07,166
is not just about composing
components together

3
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:10,000
and making sure that the
logic works correctly.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That arguably is the most important part,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,600
where at least it's the
biggest reason for using React.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,933
But building React apps is
also about styling those apps.

7
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,500
You wanna make sure that
your applications look good

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,066
and styling is also an important part

9
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,533
of building components.

10
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,866
And there are different techniques

11
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:33,166
for setting styles dynamically

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:37,200
and for styling components
such that other components

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,300
are not affected by a
specific component's styles.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,933
Therefore in this module,

15
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:45,400
we will dive into how
you can set up styles

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,400
in a conditional or dynamic way.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,400
So how you, for example,
can switch certain styles

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,933
based on some conditions.

19
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,933
For example, if a user
enters an invalid input

20
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:58,766
and you want to color the input field red,

21
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,100
something like that.

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,099
And then we'll dive into
two popular approaches

23
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,366
for scoping styles to components,

24
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,000
so for setting up styles

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,700
such that they only affect the component

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,200
and are not added as global styles.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,833
We'll have a look at styled components,

28
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:21,033
which is a third-party
library, a very popular one,

29
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:24,733
which allows us to set
up pre-styled components

30
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,233
with their own scoped styles.

31
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:31,300
And we'll have a look at a
concept called CSS modules.

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,900
And you will learn what
these different approaches

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,733
are all about, how you do work with them,

34
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:40,233
and how you could add
them to your next project.

35
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:44,233
Now, to dive into styling,
we need a demo project,

36
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:48,133
and to mix things up I got
a brand new project here.

37
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,766
Now I already prepared this one for you.

38
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:53,100
It's a very simple
project as you can tell.

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,233
You can basically add course goals,

40
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:59,166
like learn React, and that
will be added to this list.

41
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,266
You can also delete items from
there by clicking on them.

42
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,966
And that's basically it.

43
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:07,133
This project uses only
things which I covered

44
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,666
over the last course sections.

45
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:12,800
And of course, you'll find
that project attached.

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,233
You can simply download it.

47
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:17,000
You'll find the entire
project folder there.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,366
And then, once you downloaded it,

49
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:21,266
simply opened a terminal,

50
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,966
navigate into this project folder,

51
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:26,933
and to run NPM install.

52
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:30,266
This will install all
the third-party packages

53
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,200
which are required since
the attached folder

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,366
does not come with a node modules folder

55
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:40,700
because that would unnecessarily
bloat the attachment.

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,600
NPM install simply installs all packages

57
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,566
and recreates the node modules folder.

58
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,200
And thereafter you have this project here,

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,533
which you can start with NPM start

60
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,300
to start the development server

61
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,800
and play around with the project.

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,366
Of course also feel free to
dive into the source files

63
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:02,333
to see how this project is structured.

64
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:06,233
As I already said, this
project only uses features

65
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,900
which you already know, like useState

66
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,166
which you already know, like useState

67
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,766
and the functions which
are bound to events.

68
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:14,000
and the functions which
are bound to events.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,566
And we're then, for example,

70
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:20,433
also outputting lists of data
dynamically by calling map.

71
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,266
So that's all something you already saw

72
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,600
and there is nothing new there.

73
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,166
and there is nothing new there.

74
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:30,333
This however will be our
starting project for this section

75
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,666
where we are now going
to dive into styling.

76
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,433
So definitely explored
the source code files.

77
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,500
So did you understand this project

78
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,266
and thereafter we're going to have a look

79
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:43,300
at the different styling
options React gives us.
