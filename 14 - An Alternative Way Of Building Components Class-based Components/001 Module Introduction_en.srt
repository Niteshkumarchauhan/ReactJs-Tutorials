00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,450
In this course section,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,870
we are going to learn

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,140
how we may build components in React.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,290
Well, wait a second!

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,040
Isn't that something we've learned

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,540
in-depth until now already?

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,030
Well we did, but there is an alternative way

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,110
of building components.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,490
Besides building components as functions,

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,900
which is what we did up to this point,

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,130
you can also define components with classes.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,330
You can build Class-based Components.

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,030
But I get one important note, right away,

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,150
before you feel overwhelmed.

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,880
This is 100% optional,

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,140
and in most modern React projects,

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,410
you are probably not going to use this approach.

18
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,680
You can therefore skip this section,

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,470
but I wanna emphasize that you will see a lot

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,180
of Class-based Components out there, in the wild,

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,300
in third-party libraries or in projects

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,140
you might be working on, because traditionally,

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,720
not too long ago,

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,530
you had to use Class-based Components in certain cases.

25
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,160
This is no longer the case,

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,150
but I will explain all about that throughout this section.

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,710
I will explain what exactly Class-based Components are

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,360
and why they exist.

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,560
We will learn how we can build Class-based Components

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,840
and how we can work with Class-based Components,

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,970
and, we're then also going to have a look at

32
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,890
Error Boundaries, and at least this is something

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,440
you should at least take a mental note to come back to,

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,800
because Error Boundaries, right now,

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,580
require Class-based Components to be built.

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,760
That being said, you will not build

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,840
a lot of Error Boundaries.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,870
But still, this module holds important information

39
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,400
about React's past, about an alternative way

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,810
of building components,

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,560
and most importantly of course,

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,603
why that way exists and how it works.
