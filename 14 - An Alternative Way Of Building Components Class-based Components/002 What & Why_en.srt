1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,310
Now as I mentioned

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,520
in the last lecture already,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,010
Class-Based Components exist

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,630
and they are an alternative to functions.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,220
Up to this point, when we built Components,

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,530
they looked something like this.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,000
Of course, instead of the function keyword,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,510
we might have used const

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,110
and stored an arrow function in there.

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,700
But either way, we simply built a function.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,780
That is what we did.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,200
And we built a function that receives props

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,100
and then returns the JSX code

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,283
that should be rendered to the screen.

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,060
This is what Components are in React,

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,550
and they are simply regular JavaScript functions

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,930
which return some renderable results, typically JSX.

18
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,640
This is what we refer to as Functional Components,

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,650
which is a term I also already used a couple of times.

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,160
Now this term exists

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,530
because it's not the only way of building Components.

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,100
If it would be the only way,

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,540
we could just call it Components, right?

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,280
But we call it Functional Components

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,650
because there is an alternative way of defining Components.

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,500
Not of using them.

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,550
You always use them as custom HTML elements

28
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,040
in your JSX code.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,823
But for defining them, there is this alternative.

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,700
You can define a Component by creating a class,

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,310
which is a default JavaScript feature.

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,840
Classes are not a React feature,

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,410
classes exist in modern JavaScript.

34
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,310
And you can define a class with a render method

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,880
and that is a reserved name, render.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,350
It has to be named like this.

37
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,800
And then React will call that render method

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,850
to evaluate what should be rendered to the screen.

39
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,140
So this is an alternative way of defining Components.

40
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,530
And that is what is referred to as class Components

41
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,163
or Class-Based Components.

42
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,350
Now, I will emphasize the left approach,

43
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,740
using Functional Components,

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,090
is the default and most modern approach

45
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,320
of building Components these days.

46
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,390
And in most modern React projects,

47
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,210
you will therefore pretty much

48
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,520
work with Functional Components only.

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,130
You might never build a single class-based Component there

50
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,040
because nowadays with the exception of error boundaries,

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,810
which we'll have a look at later,

52
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,110
there is no reason to go for Class-Based Components.

53
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,860
Except for personal preferences, of course.

54
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,120
You can simply prefer Class-Based Components,

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,040
and that would be absolutely fine.

56
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,790
You can build anything

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,570
you can build with Functional Components

58
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,360
with Class-Based Components as well.

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,570
It just requires a different mental model

60
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,810
in some regards and some aspects.

61
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,670
Now, the Class-Based Components exist

62
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,120
because they were required in the past.

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,120
In the past, which means prior to React 16.8,

64
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,390
there were scenarios and use cases

65
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,720
where you needed Class-Based Components.

66
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,090
Specifically when dealing with State

67
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,520
and with side effects,

68
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,030
you had to use Class-Based Components.

69
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,740
Traditionally, prior to React 16.8,

70
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,800
you could not change State in Functional Components

71
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,303
and you couldn't really handle side effects there either.

72
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,520
That changed with React 16.8

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,210
because that React version

74
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,780
introduced a concept called React Hooks,

75
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,790
which are all these Hooks,

76
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,220
these functions starting with use.

77
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,280
UseState and useEffect and so on.

78
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,070
These are functions for Functional Components,

79
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,730
which bring features to Functional Components,

80
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,130
which previously were reserved for Class-Based Components.

81
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,870
And indeed, Class-Based Components can't use React Hooks.

82
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,540
That's also important.

83
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,830
That's really important.

84
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,980
What you learned about react Hooks up to this point,

85
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,450
it does not matter at all

86
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,680
when working with Class-Based Components.

87
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,690
But now in the next lectures,

88
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,150
I'll show you how you can convert

89
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,250
Functional Components to Class-Based Components,

90
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,440
how you can manage State there,

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,180
and also how you translate useEffect and useContext

92
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:50,943
and useReducer to the Class-Based Component world.
