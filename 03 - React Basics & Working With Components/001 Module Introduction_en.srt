1
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:04,819
Lecturer: So in the first course section,

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:08,320
we learned what React is and what it's about.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,354
we learned what React is and what it's about.

4
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:11,822
We had a first general overview of React

5
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:14,057
and why we might wanna use it.

6
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:15,807
In this course section,

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:19,209
we are now going to dive into all the basics

8
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:23,078
you need to know to build any kind of React app.

9
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:23,311
you need to know to build any kind of React app.

10
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:26,063
We're going to explore all the base features

11
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:28,681
and most importantly, we are going to learn

12
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,316
how to build component-driven user interfaces.

13
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:32,432
how to build component-driven user interfaces.

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,917
So how to build user interfaces

15
00:00:34,917 --> 00:00:40,086
by embracing a concept called components which turns out

16
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:42,921
is actually embraced by React.

17
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:42,971
is actually embraced by React.

18
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,222
And of course, I will explain what exactly

19
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:48,691
these components are and why React embrace system

20
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:51,108
in this course section as well.

21
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:54,160
Now specifically for that, as I said,

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,544
we're going to learn about all the base features

23
00:00:56,544 --> 00:01:00,013
that make up React, all the core syntax,

24
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,297
we're specifically also going to learn

25
00:01:02,297 --> 00:01:08,084
about a feature called JSX or a special syntax called JSX,

26
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:11,018
what that is and why we use it.

27
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:13,753
Then as I also mentioned, we're also going to learn

28
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:15,554
what these components are, but most importantly also,

29
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:17,488
what these components are, but most importantly also,

30
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:20,690
how we can build our own components with React

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,675
and how we can use them and how we can work with them.

32
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:23,958
and how we can use them and how we can work with them.

33
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,742
And we're going to learn how we can work

34
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:30,945
with data in React apps, because most web applications

35
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:33,930
are not just about showing some static text,

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,132
but about outputting some data or updating some data

37
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,999
when things change on the screen.

38
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,134
And that's therefore, all is what we're going to learn

39
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:43,651
in this course section

40
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:47,670
but also in the next course sections in general.

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,539
Now, of course, I don't want to teach these things

42
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:55,024
by just using some boring theory or slides.

43
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:55,124
by just using some boring theory or slides.

44
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:57,508
We will have all the required theory

45
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,426
that hopefully it's not boring,

46
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:03,911
but we will also build this first example project year,

47
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:06,880
this example web application.

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,531
This here it's entirely built with a React

49
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:11,749
and we are going to build it together

50
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:15,384
for this and the next course sections.

51
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:19,219
And I'm saying, and the next course sections,

52
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:23,188
because it turns out that React is a bunch of core features

53
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:23,204
because it turns out that React is a bunch of core features

54
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:26,356
and we will need a lot of these features

55
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,773
in this application.

56
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:27,873
in this application.

57
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:31,425
It might look fairly trivial, but it actually isn't.

58
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:34,910
Once we finish this first application

59
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,395
which also is not the only one in the course,

60
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:39,379
you will have learned about basically

61
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,747
all important key concepts

62
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:43,848
which you need over and over again

63
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:46,716
in any React app you're going to build.

64
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:47,000
in any React app you're going to build.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,967
Now what is that though?

66
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,501
It's an expense tracker.

67
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:54,787
We can see our expenses also by year here,

68
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:57,755
we can filter, and you see as I filter,

69
00:02:57,755 --> 00:03:01,307
does user interface automatically updates.

70
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,641
it updates and with a nice animation,

71
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,560
and it shows us the expenses for a selected year.

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,195
And of course we can also add a new expense

73
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:17,231
for example, maybe I bought some books for $39 in 2020,

74
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:22,417
let's say on December 16th, and if I add this expense here,

75
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:25,569
you see it shows up here the chart updates

76
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,021
and the data is also there if I switch to another year

77
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:32,339
and then back to 2020.

78
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:33,906
So this expense tracker

79
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:35,957
is what we're going to get started with.

80
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:38,642
And as we're going to build it step-by-step,

81
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:41,527
we are going to learn about all the key concepts

82
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:44,278
you gotta know when working with React.
