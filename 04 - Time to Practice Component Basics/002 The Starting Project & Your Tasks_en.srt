1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,920
So as mentioned, this is the project,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,550
the website we're going to build in this section.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,730
And when I say we are going to build it,

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,940
I basically mean you are going to build it,

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,360
or at least you should try building it first,

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,000
because I got a couple of tasks for you

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,700
that allow you to practice what you learned.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,600
Though of course, throughout the rest of this section here,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,856
I'm going to build this website here together with you

10
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,960
and you can follow along with me

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,710
to see how I'm tackling those tasks

12
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:38,760
and how I am building this project.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,530
But that being said, let's now take a look at

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,500
this starting project I prepared for you

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,980
and the tasks you should complete with this project.

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,540
So here's the starting project

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,390
and you of course find it attached.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,450
You also find a link to Code Sandbox attached

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,400
which you can use alternatively

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,220
if you don't want to install anything locally.

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,100
But I'm of course going to use a local environment

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,800
as I always do in this course.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,220
And in this starting project I am providing to you,

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,110
you'll find a source folder

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,060
with a couple of JavaScript files

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,080
and an assets folder with a nested images folder.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Now the only really relevant file for us is the App.js file.

28
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:26,100
In that file here, you'll already find some code

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,210
and you'll also already find a react component in there.

30
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,530
Now this component

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,010
and this overall app is not finished though.

32
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,100
Instead here in this component I got a header,

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,930
where I output an image and the image is actually imported

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,290
like this from the assets folder.

35
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,430
This is an import syntax you can use in React projects.

36
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,550
It is supported by the underlying development server

37
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,963
and build process,

38
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,110
and this is how you can use images which are stored

39
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,160
in this assets images folder here in your component files.

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,070
You simply import them, assign any name of your choice

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,870
to them, and then you use them as a dynamic source value.

42
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,140
But that's already in this file of course.

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,950
What's not in this file or what's at least not finished

44
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,430
right now is information about some of those

45
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,580
React key concepts you should be aware of.

46
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,030
Though I will say that this is just a demo website,

47
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,083
just an exercise.

48
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,570
And this is not an exhaustive list

49
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,850
of all key React concepts.

50
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,450
Instead, you're going to learn about more React concepts

51
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,773
throughout this course.

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,030
But anyways here we got an array full of objects

53
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,288
and down here the goal is to output the information

54
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:48,750
that's contained in those objects in this array.

55
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,690
But at the moment that's not happening.

56
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,660
And that's where your tasks start.

57
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,340
The first task is to output those key concepts,

58
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,280
so that key concepts data.

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,325
This data which you find in this area should be output here

60
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,500
on the screen.

61
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,560
And of course with that, I don't mean that you should copy

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,970
and paste the text.

63
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,990
Instead, you should find a different way

64
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:19,080
of outputting that data, but that's only the first task.

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,080
The second task then is to identify possible components

66
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,630
you could create, possible JSX code snippets

67
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,930
you could outsource into a separate component.

68
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,570
For that you should analyze this JSX code

69
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,740
in the app component and come up with possible components

70
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,500
this code could be split up into.

71
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,620
Now of course identifying possible components

72
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,390
isn't everything though.

73
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,560
Instead then as a last task in this section here,

74
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,090
you should then also create and use those custom components.

75
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,940
So you should create new components.

76
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,760
Also use props if you need to use them.

77
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,510
And of course once you went through all these steps

78
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,790
and once you have a working solution,

79
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,790
definitely also take a look at the remaining lectures

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,610
in this section because there I will walk you through

81
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,730
my solution, repeat some core component

82
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,709
and React concepts you must know,

83
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,820
and of course also let you know why I chose this solution

84
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,880
and why I perform certain steps.

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,394
Now in case you're getting stuck whilst trying this

86
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:29,790
on your own, also take a look at the next lecture,

87
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,680
so the lecture after this one here,

88
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,740
because that will be a hints lecture where

89
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,530
I give you some hints on how to tackle this

90
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,230
and where idea four can hopefully help you

91
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,000
come up with a solution.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,993
And with that, good luck and I'll see you in my solution.
