1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,719
So let's now take a look at our code

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,720
and identify possible components into which we could

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,013
split up the current code.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,790
For that, if you take a look at the current code,

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,880
the current JSX code, to be precise,

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,790
I got at least two components

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,950
into which this could be split up.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,320
And that would be the header component,

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,557
that could be a separate component.

10
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:32,557
And then one reusable component for those key concepts.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,280
So this list item could go into its own reusable component.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,118
We could also build a third component,

13
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:46,080
this concept component, but that is optional.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,263
You could definitely do it though, I will say that.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,610
Now, before we go ahead and build those components,

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,510
I wanna briefly explain why we could split the app

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,420
into those components I just mentioned.

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,690
And for that, I first of all want to say that of course

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,390
for a very simple website like this one here,

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,690
leaving the code like this wouldn't be wrong,

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,400
wouldn't be horrible.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,100
But of course this is just a basic demo absence,

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,190
we're just getting started with React.

24
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,160
And of course we wanna practice those key React

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,470
concepts you already learned about,

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,110
like components for example.

27
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,290
And there actually also is a good reason for

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,930
splitting this up into components.

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,500
At least a separate component for these concepts

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,260
makes a lot of sense, because right now,

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,230
if I ever decide that I wanna get rid of this

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,905
description paragraph, for example,

33
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:46,110
I have to delete this paragraph manually

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,830
in three different places to get rid of it.

35
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,680
And whilst this is of course certainly doable,

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,380
it's unnecessary repetition.

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,450
And that's something we can typically avoid

38
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,393
by using and embracing React components.
