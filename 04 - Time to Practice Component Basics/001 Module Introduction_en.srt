1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,320
So, now that we got started

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,360
with components and props,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,110
and how we can build basic React applications,

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,600
it's time to practice what we learned,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,420
and it's of course specifically time

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,330
to practice working with those components,

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,070
because as you learned,

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,030
components are a crucial React concept,

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,950
and the core building block of all those user interfaces

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,233
you are going to build with React.

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,250
Therefore, in this course section here,

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,820
we're going to build this demo application,

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,890
this very basic website

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,130
which will utilize this component concept,

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,600
or which code will utilize this component concept,

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,270
and the idea behind this section here

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,150
is that you can practice what you learned.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,070
For that, in this section,

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,180
you're going to split an existing component,

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,420
an existing React application, you could say,

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,850
into smaller components,

22
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,400
and you're therefore going to create

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,640
and use multiple custom components,

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,450
and you are also going to need to pass data

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,340
to some of those components.

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,260
So, that's also something you're going to do

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,360
in this course section.

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,460
In the next lecture, I'll provide you

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,030
with a starting project and your main tasks,

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,380
and thereafter,

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,073
you should try to complete those tasks on your own.
