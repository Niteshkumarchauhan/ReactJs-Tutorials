1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,440
So let's now solve these tasks.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,360
And for that, of course, we're going to start

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,803
with the first task where we output the key concepts data.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,400
Now, the data is already here

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,670
in app js in this concepts array.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,080
And now, the goal is to output that data down there.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,840
And if you take a look at this unordered list here

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,450
where the concept data should be output,

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,960
you can see that I already got one list item there,

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,800
but at the moment, it only contains dummy content here,

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,413
only dummy data.

12
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,570
That now needs to be replaced

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,900
with the actual data from these objects.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,860
And as I mentioned,

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,016
the goal is now not to copy and paste that data,

16
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:51,120
but instead to dynamically access the data

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,070
in that concepts array.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,350
And in React, you can do that

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,840
by using single curly braces,

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,643
as you learned opening and closing single curly braces.

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,610
Between those curly braces,

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,590
you can put any JavaScript expression that yields a value.

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,230
You could, for example, put one plus one in here.

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,060
But, of course, that's not the goal here.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,180
Instead, here for the image, I want to refer

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,980
to this image or precisely to the value stored

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,733
under the image key in this first object in this array.

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,780
So, this value stored under this image key

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,243
in the first object of this array.

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,850
To output that image here, we can go to this source here.

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,340
So, between those curly braces,

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,103
reference this Concepts array by its name.

33
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,470
And then, since it's an array,

34
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,960
and I want to access the first element in there,

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,930
I can use square brackets zero

36
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,170
which does access the first element in that array.

37
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,233
And that first element will be this object here.

38
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,590
And then, this object I now want to get access

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,010
to that value that's stored under the key image.

40
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,710
So therefore, we can use the dot notation here

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,530
and access image like this.

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,753
And this will output the image here.

43
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,160
Now, I also want to set the alt text dynamically,

44
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,040
and I wanna set this to the title of this concept.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,430
And therefore, here we again need curly braces

46
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,580
to dynamically output some content here.

47
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,280
And then, we use concepts again,

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,420
square bracket zero,

49
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,260
because we're still working on the same Concepts object.

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,983
And then, dot title gives us access to the title.

51
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,199
And that's actually also exactly the code

52
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,390
I need down here to output the title as text.

53
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,163
So, between those H2 tags.

54
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,980
And then, here, for the paragraph

55
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,500
where I want to output the description

56
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,413
I want to access Concepts, zero description.

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,770
With that, we should be outputting data

58
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,820
about the first key concept in that Concepts array.

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,910
Now, to see this in action here on my local machine,

60
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,040
I need to start this development server,

61
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,712
which in Visual Studio Code can be done

62
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,770
by opening a new terminal and running NPM start.

63
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,660
Though, for this to succeed, I first must run NPM install

64
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,090
to install all those extra dependencies

65
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,630
including that build process that's used behind the scenes.

66
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,460
And you only need to do this once

67
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,940
as you learned when you initially set up a project.

68
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,733
And thereafter, we can run NPM start,

69
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:36,540
and this will now start that development server.

70
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,092
And then, once I visit local host 3000

71
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:43,263
I can indeed see this key concept here on the screen.

72
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,425
It's quite big for me here,

73
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:47,610
because I zoomed in quite a bit,

74
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,520
so that you can see it really well as well.

75
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,040
And I got a light hover effect here,

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,683
but clicking doesn't actually do anything here.

77
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,690
It's just a visual effect.

78
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,230
But, this is now the first key concept being output here.

79
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,061
It's not the only key concept we got though.

80
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:08,370
Instead, if we take a look here at this Concepts array,

81
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,713
we of course got two more objects in there.

82
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:16,620
And the goal, of course, is to also output those concepts.

83
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,055
And therefore, what we can do for now,

84
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,120
and what will change later is

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,670
that we copy and paste this list item.

86
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,270
And now, access Concepts one image,

87
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,240
Concepts one title also here

88
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,240
and also Concepts one description.

89
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,400
And this will access the second element

90
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,750
in this Concepts array.

91
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,640
And then, access image, title

92
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,910
and description for that second element.

93
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,332
And, of course,

94
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,210
we can then also repeat this one last time here

95
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,280
for the third element

96
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,280
where we dare for access Concepts two image,

97
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,430
Concepts two title also here

98
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,683
and Concepts two description.

99
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,050
And with that, we'll be outputting all three concepts

100
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,740
for the moment simply by copy and pasting this code.

101
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,753
But, that of course will change soon.

102
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,660
If you save that though,

103
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,630
and you got that development server up and running,

104
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,773
you will now see these three key concepts on the screen.

105
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,910
And that, theoretically is of course

106
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,650
already the final solution.

107
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,803
It's the final website we want to build here,

108
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,080
but it's not the final solution for those tasks I gave you.

109
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,200
It's only the solution for the first task,

110
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,780
because whilst we got a working solution

111
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,680
we don't have the best possible working solution.

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,420
Instead, the next task is to identify possible components

113
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,143
before we then also build and use those components.
