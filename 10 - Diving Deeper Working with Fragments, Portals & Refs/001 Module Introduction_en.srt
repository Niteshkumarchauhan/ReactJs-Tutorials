1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,800
In this module, it's time for

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,280
Fragments, Portals, and Refs.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,370
Okay, what's that?

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,180
That will be more tools

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,950
in our react toolbox that help us solve more problems.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,050
And in this module

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,410
we'll simply go through these different features

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,670
and you will learn which problems they solve

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,500
and why we need them and how you can use them, of course.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,700
We'll have a look at

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,030
limitations we're actually facing with JSX code

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,740
and how fragments can help us overcome those limitations.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,830
We'll learn how we can derive a cleaner DOM,

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,210
a better code structure with the help

15
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,460
of portals and we'll work with Refs

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,033
and learn what Refs actually are and why we need them.
