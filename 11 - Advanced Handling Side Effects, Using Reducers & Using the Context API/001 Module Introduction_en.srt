1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,680
Now with the core basics and the foundation

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,200
about React and its most important features out of the way

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,080
and applied to our course project,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,780
we're gonna take the next step in this module.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,300
We're gonna have a look at three very important concepts

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,780
which you need to know as a React developer

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,930
and that will be effects, reducers and context.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,730
Now these features are a little bit more advanced

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,510
which does not mean that they're difficult.

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,910
This just means you need know the other concepts first

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,650
which is why we are now diving into those concepts here

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,470
and with those features,

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,640
you will be able to make a huge step forward

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,960
towards more complex React applications.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,020
Now in this module we will therefore take a closer look

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,250
at what effects are and how you can work

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,330
with so-called side effects which is what effects means,

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,540
but more on that in a second.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,840
We'll have a look at how we can manage more complex state

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,830
in our components with reducers

21
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,600
and we will explore app-wide

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,760
or at least component-wide state so states that affect

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,660
multiple components with a concept called context

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,850
which is built into React to make sharing

25
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,653
state and state updates across components easier.

26
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,740
A lot of important features that are included here

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,893
so let's not waste any time and let's dive right in.
