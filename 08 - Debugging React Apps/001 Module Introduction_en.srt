00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,633
- [Instructor] We learned a lot about

2
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:06,833
some of the most important
features of React,

3
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:11,566
also about its core pillars
and how you style React apps.

4
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:14,133
Now, when you're building apps with React,

5
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:17,033
or in general, if you're
working as a developer,

6
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:19,300
you will encounter errors,

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,700
that will always happen,

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,500
you'll never write code
that is error free.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,200
During your development process,

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,300
you will always face errors.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,900
And in this module, you will
learn how to debug React apps.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,800
So how you can find and fix errors,

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,666
because that's one of
the most important things

14
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,500
you need to be able to do as a developer,

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,200
it's often overlooked and I
see way too many developers

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,400
or all the students in my courses

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,000
that simply ask immediately
that they get an error,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,600
they immediately look
for others to help them

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,300
and that's the wrong approach,

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,333
you need to be able to find
and solve errors on your own

21
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,933
because errors will always
be a part of development.

22
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,300
Therefore in this module,

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,700
we will explore how you can
make sense of the error messages

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,866
React froze at you in
certain circumstances,

25
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,733
we will learn how we can debug

26
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,366
and analyze React apps in general,

27
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:23,100
how we can understand our
code whilst it's executing,

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,233
and we'll explore the React Dev Tools,

29
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:29,500
an extra extension we can
install in the browser

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,400
to get a better React
developer experience.
