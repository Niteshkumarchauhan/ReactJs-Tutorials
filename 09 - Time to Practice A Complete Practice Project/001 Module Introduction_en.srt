1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,080
At this point in the course,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,310
you already learned a lot about some crucial core

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,830
React concepts, and of course,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,720
you're going to learn even more

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,730
throughout the rest of this course.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,890
But before you go there,

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,890
before you dive deeper into React, I strongly recommend

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,510
that you first practice what you learned

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,860
and that's exactly what this core section will be there for.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,330
In this core section,

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,660
we're going to build two demo projects,

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,070
two basic yet non-trivial demo projects,

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,040
which allow you to apply your knowledge

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,050
and to practice what you learned.

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,080
Because in both projects you'll need to work

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,920
with components, state, some styling

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,610
and all these crucial core concepts we explored

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,980
throughout the previous sections.

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,230
Therefore, in this section here,

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,890
you'll practice how to split an existing component

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,250
and an existing application into multiple components,

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,290
and you'll also practice how to build

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,870
an application from scratch.

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,960
You will practice how to work with state,

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,030
how to manage and use state,

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,030
and you'll practice outputting list and conditional content.

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,350
Now, for both practice projects

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,440
which I prepared for you for this section here,

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,320
I will give you an introduction to those projects.

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,690
I'll provide you with some starting code

31
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,490
and I'll give you some tasks

32
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,880
or show you how the finished project should look like,

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,670
but I then absolutely would recommend

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,610
that you first try solving these tasks

35
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,190
and building those projects on your own

36
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,550
before you then take a look at my example solution,

37
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,320
which I of course will also provide as part of this section.

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,650
Because by trying these things on your own first,

39
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,200
you'll of course learn more about React

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,220
and you'll be able to confirm that you really understood

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,430
all these core concepts up to this point.

42
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,630
That being said, after every demo project introduction,

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,440
I will provide you with detailed solution steps

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,500
allowing you to compare your solution to mine,

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,200
and of course, whilst building that solution together

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,550
with you, I'll also explain why I chose a certain approach

47
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,840
and why I solved the tasks as I did solve them.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,570
So definitely take a look at my solution as well,

49
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,293
but also definitely try those projects on your own first.
