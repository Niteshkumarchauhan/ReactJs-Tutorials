Hi, and welcome to this course!

2
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:06,233
My name is Maximilian Schwarzmueller
and I will be your instructor

3
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:09,433
in this course where I will teach you
React from the ground

4
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:12,100
up, step by step, and in great depth!

5
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:16,600
In this first course section here,
I'll get you started with this course,

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,400
and get some organizational things
out of the way -

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,966
what you should know about React
and this course - and thereafter,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,333
after an optional JavaScript
refresher section,

9
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:30,066
which you can take if it's been some time
since you last worked with JavaScript,

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,300
we're going to dive right in and explore
React in great detail.

11
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:38,100
And speaking of that, let's start
with the most

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,366
important question: What exactly is React?
