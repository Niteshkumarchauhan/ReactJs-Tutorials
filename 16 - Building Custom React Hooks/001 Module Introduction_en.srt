[Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller] As you can probably

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,270
tell by now we are diving deeper and deeper into React.

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,860
And in this module, we're going to have a look

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,170
at another core concept, which you will use

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,820
in a lot of React apps you're going to build

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,370
and that will be Custom Hooks

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:23,350
and how you can build your own Custom Hooks.

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,910
Now, up to this point in this course

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,570
we already worked a lot with Hooks,

10
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,770
with the built in React Hooks React offers

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,019
to us like useState, UseReducer, UseEffect

12
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:38,060
UseContext and so on.

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,060
So all these special React functions that start with Use.

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,880
You might remember that when I talked

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,230
about the rules of Hooks, I mentioned that

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,020
you can only use React Hooks

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,770
in React Component Functions and in Custom Hooks.

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,850
And I told you that those would be covered later.

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,200
Well, now is later.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,519
Now we're going to explore how you can build your own Hooks,

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,680
why you might want to do that,

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,640
How exactly you do that, of course,

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,518
And we're going to do that

24
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,640
as a concrete example or multiple examples.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,350
And we're also going to learn about the rules

26
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,880
and practices and best practices that apply when

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,033
you build your own Custom Hooks.
