1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,870
Over the last course sections,

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,480
the learning curve got a bit steeper

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,270
and we had a look

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,130
at more advanced yet crucial react concepts.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,890
Especially of course, when we had a look at react hooks

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,570
like use effect, use context and also use reducer.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,760
Therefore, before we dive deeper

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,130
into react, this course section is there

9
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,080
for you to practice what you learned together

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,930
with me by building another course project,

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,130
the Food Order app.

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,960
Now, of course we have demos in all course sections

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,950
but this is another slightly bigger application,

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,900
where all the key things you learned

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,550
throughout the last course sections again, come together

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,760
and can be seen in the context of a bigger project.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,410
And of course, we're not just going to have a look

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,680
at those concepts covered in the last section,

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
but we will again see all core react features

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,723
in action, including components, state, and much more.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,110
Now this is the application we are going to build.

22
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,700
It's a simple dummy food order app

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,260
where we got a list of meals from which we can choose.

24
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,720
And we can then add these meals to the cart,

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,310
also changed their amounts and also add them multiple times.

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,440
And of course we can also view the carts to see what's

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,840
in the cart here.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
We can also change our cart from that page if we want to.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
And ultimately we can, of course also click order, though

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,690
for the moment that won't do anything.

31
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,590
Instead, it will just add a little output here

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,100
in the console,

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,760
but we will, of course also have a closer look

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,640
at how we can store data in a database

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,710
or do other things with that later in the course.

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,840
But for the moment, this application is there

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,720
to practice all those key features we had a look

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,410
at over the last course sections.

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,550
Now, if you feel like it, you can

40
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,979
of course also try this on your own.

41
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,960
Attached to this lecture,

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,340
you find all the CSS files I plan to use

43
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,750
throughout this section,

44
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,630
and these file names also give you an idea

45
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,240
of which components I plan to use,

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,880
but this is totally optional.

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,340
It is a nice practice, but it will also be a big challenge.

48
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,980
Therefore it might definitely be worth a try,

49
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,280
but we can also simply walk through all

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,560
of that together,

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,290
to again practice all

52
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,000
these key concepts step-by-step together,

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,030
to make sure that after

54
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,660
this course section everything we learned up

55
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,403
to this point is super clear.
