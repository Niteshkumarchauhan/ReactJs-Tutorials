1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,040
At this point in the course

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,420
we already learned a lot about React,

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,630
though I will say there also is more left to be learned.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,410
But everything we learned up to this point

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,210
was about React doing things

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,627
inside of our app, in the browser.

7
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:20,980
And of course, that is why we do use React.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,730
That is its main job

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,300
but we also only worked with local data up to this point.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,770
So we only played around with dummy data

11
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,270
which was always just managed and stored in the browser.

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,640
In this course section, we are going to dive

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,690
into how you may connect your React Application

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,160
to a backend, to a database.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,850
Because of course, many applications

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,950
probably all applications need to fetch data

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,000
from a database or store some data in a database eventually.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
No matter if we're talking about

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,430
users that need to be created

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,596
and stored and locked in, or if we're talking about products

21
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:04,840
that need to be loaded or anything like that.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,530
And therefore this section

23
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,300
is about establishing such a connection.

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,170
And it is about Sending Http Requests

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,700
from inside our React App to a backend.

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,390
And specifically we are going to learn

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,080
how exactly React Apps do interact with Databases?

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,050
Because whilst it's simple, as you will learn

29
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,510
it will not necessarily work as you expect it to work.

30
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,530
You will learn how you can send Http Requests

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,610
and work with responses, which you get back.

32
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,010
And we're going to have a look at how we can handle Errors

33
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,083
and Loading States in our application.
